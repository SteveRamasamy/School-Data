# School Performance Analysis
School Analysis
In the school summary, both critical areas, Math and Reading skills, demonstrate nearly identical performance, falling within a 70-point range of average grades. When comparing the pass rates in Math and Reading to the overall pass rate, it becomes evident that these pivotal subjects yield superior outcomes, translating into a significant scoring advantage of at least 10 percent more in Math and Reading scores compared to the overall passing rate. However, a more comprehensive analysis will delve into the potential impact of budget allocation on enhancing performance in these key subjects, scrutinizing the performance at the school level.

Surprisingly, the top five performing schools predominantly consist of medium and large-sized institutions, with no representation from smaller-sized schools. Strikingly, the classification of schools as government or independent holds little sway over performance, as both types perform comparably. The top five list encompasses an almost equal distribution of government and independent schools. Paradoxically, the lower-performing schools are primarily large and government-funded, despite some of them receiving substantial per-student budgets, surpassing those allocated to higher-performing government schools. This indicates that a significant budget and school size do not necessarily guarantee commendable performance in both Math and Reading.

Analysis of Reading and Math scores across year levels 9 to 12 reveals a consistent distribution without significant disparities within each student cohort. Intriguingly, schools with lower budget allocations per student outshine their counterparts with higher budgets, with the difference approaching 10%. This underscores that student performance is not strictly dictated by budgetary provisions.

Contrary to intuition, there exists no correlation between increased per-student expenditure and improved performance in key subjects. On the reverse, higher spending appears to associate with a decline in the overall pass rate by almost 10 percentage points. This suggests that financial support does contribute positively to Math and Reading performance, but an indiscriminate influx of funds does not necessarily equate to better results. It may be advisable to reallocate some funds to different subject areas to enhance the overall pass rate, implying that a more balanced distribution of resources could lead to improvements across the board.

Key Takeaways:

Pass rates in key subjects surpass the overall pass rate with positive support, which may include financial assistance.

Both government and independent schools perform equally well among the top schools, but government schools are among the poorest performers.

Greater budget allocation does not guarantee higher scores in key subjects and may even lead to negative performance in other subject areas.

Redistributing the budget towards other subject areas could enhance the overall pass rate for a balanced outcome.

Financial support positively impacts student performance across all years.
